PROCEDURE-
Load the Titanic dataset: We will use a publicly available Titanic dataset, typically included in libraries like Seaborn or Kaggle.
Inspect the data:
Check for missing values.
Understand data types and basic statistics.
Explore distributions:
Analyze numerical features (e.g., age, fare) using histograms and box plots.
Examine categorical features (e.g., sex, embarked) using count plots.
Identify correlations:
Use heatmaps to visualize correlations between numerical features.
Explore relationships:
Scatter plots for numerical relationships.
Bar plots or violin plots to analyze relationships between categorical and numerical features.
Highlight outliers:
Use box plots to detect potential outliers in numerical features.

The code performs EDA on the Titanic dataset. It includes loading the data, inspecting it for missing values, analyzing distributions, and visualizing correlations and relationships.
